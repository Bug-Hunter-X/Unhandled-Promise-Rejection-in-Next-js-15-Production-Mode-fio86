# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Next.js 15 Production

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications where unhandled promise rejections can occur during data fetching in dynamic routes, particularly in production environments.  The issue revolves around how errors thrown within `async` functions in page components are handled (or rather, not handled) by default.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data.  If the data fetch fails (simulated in this example), it throws an error. In production, this error is not gracefully handled, causing the application to crash or display an unexpected error message to users. 

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file shows the solution.  The key is to wrap the data fetching logic in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors.  If an error occurs, we can gracefully degrade (display an error message or fallback content) instead of crashing the application.  Further enhancements might involve centralized error reporting or custom error boundaries for a more robust error handling mechanism.
